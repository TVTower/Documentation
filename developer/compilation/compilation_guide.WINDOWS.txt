Compilation Guide WINDOWS
-------------------------

- download the most current pre-build buildpackage
    bmx-ng.X.XX.Windows_x86_64.tar.gz
  from
    https://github.com/GWRon/BMXNG-Packs
- unzip (for now we call this folder "BlitzMax")


- download/clone TVTower from
    https://github.com/GWRon/TVTower

- either compile via command line, or via editor
  - command line
    - move into "BlitzMax/bin"
    - for x86
      "bmk.exe makeapp -r -g x86 -quick -w path/to/TVTower/TVTower.bmx"
    - for x64
      "bmk.exe makeapp -r -g x64 -quick -w path/to/TVTower/TVTower.bmx"
  - via editor
    - open up BlitzMax/MaxIDE_Win** (the one corresponding to your OS)
    - open "path/to/TVTower/TVTower.bmx"
    - adjust settings
      "Program"
        "Build Options"
          [x] Quick Build
          [ ] Build GUI App
          [x] Overload Warnings
    - click the flying rocket to build + run TVTower

  - a script also creates a "TVTower_Win**.exe" file after compilation
    but the binary "TVTower.exe" is kept, as this is used by the MaxIDE-
    debugger (not needed for you to play the game)
