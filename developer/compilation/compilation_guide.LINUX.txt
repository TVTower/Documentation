Compilation Guide LINUX
-----------------------

- download the most current pre-build buildpackage
    bmx-ng.X.XX.Linux_x86_64.tar.xz
  from
    https://github.com/bmx-ng/bmx-ng/releases
- unzip (for now we call this folder "BlitzMax")
- if needed, mark as executable ("chmod +x"):
  BlitzMax/bin/bcc
  BlitzMax/bin/bmk
  BlitzMax/bin/makedocs
  BlitzMax/bin/docmods
  BlitzMax/MaxIDE

- in order to update modules later, you can copy updateMod.sh to BlitMax
  execution will delete existing modules and fetch the latest versions from github
  be sure to backup a working BlitzMax before doing so as your bmx-ng and the modules
  may have become incompatible in the meantime
- after an update you may have to rebuild the modules; use the corresponding option in
  the MaxIDE Program menu


- download/clone TVTower from
    https://github.com/TVTower/TVTower

- either compile via command line, or via editor
  - command line
    - move into "BlitzMax/bin"
    - for x86
      "./bmk makeapp -r -g x86 -quick -w path/to/TVTower/TVTower.bmx"
    - for x64
      "./bmk makeapp -r -g x64 -quick -w path/to/TVTower/TVTower.bmx"
  - via editor
    - open up BlitzMax/MaxIDE (the one corresponding to your OS)
    - open "path/to/TVTower/TVTower.bmx"
    - adjust settings
      "Program"
        "Build Options"
          [x] Quick Build
          [ ] Build GUI App
          [x] Overload Warnings
    - click the flying rocket to build + run TVTower

  - a script also creates a "TVTower_Linux**" file after compilation
    but the binary "TVTower" is kept, as this is used by the MaxIDE-
    debugger (not needed for you to play the game)
